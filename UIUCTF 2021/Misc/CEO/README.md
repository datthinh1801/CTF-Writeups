## Solution
From the instruction and the downloadable `.cap` file, I can guess that I need to crack the password from this file.  

When apllying the filter `eapol` in Wireshark, I can see some packets containing the exchanging key.

> Also, here is the 4-way handshake of WPA1.  

To crack the password, I use `aircrack-ng` as follows:
```
# sudo aircrack-ng <.cap file> -w <wordlist>
sudo aircrack-ng megacorp-01.cap -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/bt4-password.txt
```  

The reason why I chose the `bt4-password.txt` is of randomness ðŸ¤£. As I tried some of them and this one worked.

Flag: `uiuctf{nanotechnology}`
